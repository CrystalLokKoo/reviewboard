=================================
Review Board 1.6.10 Release Notes
=================================

**Release date**: TBD


New Features
============

* The "x minutes ago" timestamps now update live on the page. No need to
  reload to see how long ago something was. This also helps with caching
  issues.

* Added a ``RB_EXTRA_MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`` setting for
  :file:`settings_local.py`.

  This can be used to include additional Django middleware. It's a specialized
  feature that is only really needed in very specific setups.


Performance Enhancements
========================

This version of Review Board is the fastest ever. We have greatly tuned our
database queries, session handling, and other bits of logic, and this makes a
noticeable impact on performance. All pages load faster, particularly review
requests and diffs.

There's still more we'll do over the next few releases. In the meantime,
given the level of changes needed for the optimizations in this release, there
may be a bug here and there that we have not hit during our dogfooding.

Let us know if something is misbehaving that worked in previous releases and
we'll look into it.


API Changes
===========

* The new Hosting Service Account resource payload key has been changed from
  ``hosting-service-account`` to ``hosting_service_account``.


Bug Fixes
=========

* Very large lines no longer slow Review Board to a crawl.

  Applying syntax highlighting and determining what changed within a line
  assumed that the length of a line wasn't too huge. However, some minified
  files could reach hundreds of thousands of characters in length, and would
  easily break. Now, long lines (over 1,000 characters) have syntax
  highlighting and extra features turned off.

* All errors that occur when verifying a repository should now be shown,
  instead of causing an HTTP 500 error.

* Closing or reopening an issue no longer causes excessive checks for
  update notification bubbles.

* Fixed compatibility issues with newer versions of Mercurial with
  version numbers containing a ``+`` in them. Patch by Dean Prichard.

* Mercurial no longer forces an HTTP URL for downloading files from a
  repository when an HTTPS URL is specified. (:bug:`2555`)

* Mercurial support on Google Code now works properly. Patch by
  Nate Skulic. (:bug:`2585`)
